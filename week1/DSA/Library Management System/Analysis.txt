Analysis:
Time Complexity:
1.Linear Search:
Best Case: O(1) - The desired book is the first one in the list.
Average Case: O(n) - On average, half of the books will be checked.
Worst Case: O(n) - The desired book is the last one or not present.

2.Binary Search:
Best Case: O(1) - The desired book is at the midpoint initially.
Average Case: O(log n) - Each step cuts the search interval in half.
Worst Case: O(log n) - The desired book is found after log n steps.

When to Use Each Algorithm:

1.Linear Search:
Unsorted Data: When the list of books is not sorted.
Small Data Sets: For small lists, the difference in performance between linear and binary search is negligible.
Occasional Searches: When search operations are infrequent, and the overhead of sorting the list is not justified.

2.Binary Search:
Sorted Data: When the list of books is already sorted by title.
Large Data Sets: For large lists, binary search is significantly faster than linear search.
Frequent Searches: When search operations are frequent, the initial cost of sorting the list is outweighed by the faster search times.
Summary:
In a library management system, linear search is simple and effective for unsorted or small datasets, while binary search is more efficient for sorted or large datasets. For optimal performance in a system with frequent search operations and a large dataset, maintaining a sorted list and using binary search is recommended.
