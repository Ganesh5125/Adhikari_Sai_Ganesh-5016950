Understand Search Algorithms:
1.Linear Search:
Description: A straightforward search algorithm that checks each element in the list sequentially until the desired element is found or the list ends.
Time Complexity:
Best Case: O(1) - When the desired element is the first in the list.
Average Case: O(n) - On average, half of the elements will be checked.
Worst Case: O(n) - When the desired element is the last in the list or not present at all.

2.Binary Search:
Description: A more efficient search algorithm that works on sorted lists. It repeatedly divides the search interval in half. If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, it narrows the interval to the lower half. Otherwise, it narrows it to the upper half. This process continues until the value is found or the interval is empty.
Time Complexity:
Best Case: O(1) - When the middle element is the desired element.
Average Case: O(log n)
Worst Case: O(log n)
