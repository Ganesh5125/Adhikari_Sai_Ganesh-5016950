Understand Array Representation:
Array Representation in Memory:
Contiguous Memory Allocation: Arrays are stored in contiguous memory locations. This means that each element is stored next to the previous one in memory.
Indexing: The elements can be accessed directly using their index, providing O(1) time complexity for access.

Advantages of Arrays:
Constant Time Access: Direct access to elements using indices.
Memory Efficiency: Low overhead due to the contiguous memory allocation.
Ease of Traversal: Simple to iterate over all elements
