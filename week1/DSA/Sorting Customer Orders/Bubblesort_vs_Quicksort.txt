Comparing the Performance of Bubble Sort and Quick Sort:
Time Complexity Comparison:
1.Bubble Sort:
Best Case: O(n) - When the array is already sorted.
Average Case: O(n^2) - Due to the nested loops comparing and swapping elements.
Worst Case: O(n^2) - When the array is sorted in reverse order.

2.Quick Sort:
Best Case: O(n log n) - When the pivot divides the array into two nearly equal halves.
Average Case: O(n log n) - On average, the pivot divides the array reasonably well.
Worst Case: O(n^2) - When the pivot is the smallest or largest element (can be mitigated with good pivot selection strategies).

Why Quick Sort is Generally Preferred Over Bubble Sort?
Efficiency: Quick Sort is much more efficient for large datasets due to its average case time complexity of O(nlogn) compared to Bubble Sort's O(n^2).
Scalability: Quick Sort scales better as the size of the dataset increases. For small datasets, the difference might be negligible, but for large datasets, Quick Sort is significantly faster.
Adaptability: Quick Sort can be optimized with different pivot selection methods (e.g., median-of-three, randomized pivot) to avoid the worst-case scenario.
Memory Usage: Quick Sort is an in-place sorting algorithm, meaning it requires only a small, constant amount of additional storage space.
Bubble Sort is simpler to implement but is rarely used in practice due to its inefficiency for all but the smallest datasets or those that are almost sorted.
