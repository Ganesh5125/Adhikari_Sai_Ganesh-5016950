Analysis:
Time Complexity:
Add Product: O(1) - Average case for insertion in HashMap.
Update Product: O(1) - Average case for updating an entry in HashMap.
Delete Product: O(1) - Average case for deletion in HashMap.
Optimization:
Caching: Implement a caching mechanism to store frequently accessed products.
Batch Operations: Use batch processing for adding or updating multiple products at once to reduce overhead.
Indexing: If the inventory grows significantly, consider using secondary indexing techniques to improve search times.
Concurrency: Implement thread-safe mechanisms if the system needs to handle concurrent operations.
