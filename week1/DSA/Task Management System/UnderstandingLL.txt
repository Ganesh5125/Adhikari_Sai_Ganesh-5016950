Understand Linked Lists
Types of Linked Lists
1.Singly Linked List:
Structure: Each node contains a data element and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence.
Operations: Efficient at sequential access, insertion, and deletion from the beginning of the list. Less efficient for access to arbitrary elements.
Use Cases: Suitable for applications where insertions and deletions are more frequent at the beginning or end of the list.

2.Doubly Linked List:
Structure: Each node contains a data element, a reference to the next node, and a reference to the previous node.
Operations: Allows traversal in both directions. More efficient for insertions and deletions at both ends of the list.
Use Cases: Useful for applications that require bidirectional traversal and more complex insertion/deletion operations.
